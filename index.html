			<h1>Futuristic Roller Coaster Wagon Design</h1>
			<p>I'm looking for an experienced 3D designer specialized in <strong>Solidworks</strong> to create a body for a roller coaster wagon.</p>
			<p>This project requires a keen eye for aesthetics, as well as a solid understanding of mechanical engineering principles to incorporate a working seat restraint mechanism with a lock system. The design will be built upon an existing base that includes a differential-like mechanism for the front and back wheels, allowing rotation on the front axis for track twists.</p>

            <h2>Objectives:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Futuristic Body Design: Develop a 3D model of the roller coaster wagon body. The body should seamlessly integrate with and conceal the underlying "gear box" mechanism, incorporating side panels for a sleek look.</li>
                <li>Functional Seat Restraints: Engineer a working design for seat restraints for four seats, including a lock mechanism that ensures passenger safety without compromising the overall design aesthetic.</li>
                <li>3D Printing Optimization: While the primary focus is on the digital design, ensuring the model is practical for physical creation, including restraints.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="design-specifications">
            <h2>Design Specifications:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Seats: The wagon should include four seats.</li>
                <li>Restraint Mechanism: Detailed engineering of the restraint system, ensuring it is functional.</li>
                <li>Integration with Existing Mechanism: The design must accommodate the existing differential-like mechanism, with specific attention to the four screw holes for attaching the body to the "crawler" mechanism.</li>
                <li>Aesthetics: The design should project a futuristic theme, with smooth lines and innovative features that suggest speed and technology.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="design-specifications">
			<p>Deliverables: Solidworks document of the 3D model, including all components (body, seats, and restraint mechanisms). A detailed report or presentation on the design process, focusing on the mechanical functionality and aesthetic considerations, is also required.</p>
